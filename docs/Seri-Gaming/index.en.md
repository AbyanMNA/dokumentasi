# Gaming Series
This document about gaming. Not all.... Just Genshin
and HSR still I try for documentation. May another game have
related.

## Start gaming
Before play, how device specification(s)? English must know? No no no, just know
and able. Not grammar.

### Specification for gaming
Just think of Uthabiti Kachina as an example other than Fulan. Just call she
Kachina. Kachina wants to play games. If the device is a computer or cellphone, here's understanding the correct specifications.

Kachina is still limited in finances. It's a different story if your finances
are stable. Kachina is not alone. She was accompanied by Stelle and Welt Yang
from Honkai: Star Rail. There are things you should pay attention to when
choosing specifications:

1. **Make sure you really understand the price and device details**<br/>
**FINANCE** is important. If you want to buy, you should look at reviews or see
the right price. Kachina, accompanied by Stelle as a friend **who knows IT
(information technology), is ready to give directions**. It can be recommended.
2. **Make sure to play games that are suitable for yourself**<br/>
If you play games because you're with friends, that's no problem. Better check
out the gameplay trailer review. If it feels right, just follow next.
3. **Storage, RAM, and graphics**<br/>
Stelle informed and was given an understanding by Welt Yang, "The type of
storage, RAM and graphics are important to provide a comfortable feeling when
playing." Oh, if someone has an FPS limit of 15 to 60, **at least don't force**
**disable the FPS limit**. A graphics card is highly recommended because it
helps in 3D processes and processes that require a GPU. The type of storage
depends on the price. **Kachina wants to save money but it's difficult, is it**
**difficult again? Go back to step 1**.
4. **Input device(s) and Input Controller**<br/>
FOR PC AND/OR WANT A CONTROLLER DEVICE. Devices without a controller will
not run. At least Kachina wanted to consider the controller device. If you're
not sure about the device, it's better to do what the game allows.
5. **INTERNET (OPTIONAL)**<br/>
AND NOT OPTIONAL. Adjust from the game play and make sure check required internet
connection. Likewise internet connection speed, durability, and price.
6. **Electric (electronic)**<br/>
Ah..., that's why electronic devices need electricity? Actually, games don't
need electricity, such as snakes and ladders, hide and seek, and ball.
**Check the electrical power capacity and make sure the device does not exceed**
**that capacity (with the amount of usage)**.

If OK, Let's play. Don't forget limitation age and playing game used.

## Ready to play?
