# IA and AI

IA gives us memories of exploring the past as well as a sudden librarian.
AI makes it easy for us to chat and interact in anything that is very difficult.

## IA

!!! warning "For Mainland China"

    Access to information regarding IA is very limited. It is recommended to be
    careful inside access it because the sensors are very tight and need to be
    resistant to things which is strange. IA continues to be careful with
    information and metadata.

### What is IA?
If you think IA is from Vocaloid, of course not. Here IA is the Internet
Archives. What is Internet Archive? an agency in The library sector provides easy
access to information about the past and nostalgia and archived memories. This
agency DOES NOT PROFIT: Rely volunteers and donors.

### IA Features

#### Wayback Machine
This feature provides page archives from the start of the release until it has
been finally archived. These savings are used as memories and access to
information if a page or page of the site suddenly disappears.

#### Open Library
Open and legal access to information for the public, including librarians. This
access is obtained through digitalization of book printing and books that can be
used as literature for free. Currently there are still problems in accessing
information because outside parties want to make a profit.

#### Saved from Communities and Individual (Personal)
The purpose of this savings is savings archived by individuals or communities
through contributors. This storage contains software and archived images.

#### Archive.IT
The service is subscription based and can be paid once in this service. If used
and financially capable, this can be useful in archives as well as memories in
service without requiring a lot of IT assistance.

### IA Easiness
Hanya sebagai kenangan dan nostalgia. Setidaknya menyelamatkan dari kehilangan
informasi.

### May have know problem that IA will do

The initial problems started from outside parties who wanted royalties or profits
and DID NOT WANT TO BE OPEN FOR FREE. This dispute could arise due to problems
with access to online information after the 2020 Miladiyah pandemic. It only
receives information. Actually, I already understand that HE is only accepting.

The hacking of user data occurred during an extraordinary slander that thought IA
supported Israel's initials. In fact, IT is only a NEUTRAL NON PROFIT INSTANCE.
Very lucky and one of the IA teams is still fine and the data is in accordance
with the United States National Security (NIST).

Limited information and finances are a challenge for IA. At least it can be done
for nostalgia.

## AI

### What is AI?
After IA, now about AI. Wow, how is it different from being upside down? Just swap
letters. Okay. AI is Artificial Intelligence (what did?). Too short? OK OK. AI is
artificial intelligence whose intelligence is similar to and almost equal to
humans.

### AI Phase

    This historical tend. You can learn and read more with search AI phase or talk
    with AI or your choiced character in AI

#### Firstly Machine Learning
The concept of machine learning has actually been around for a long time, but it
was only in the 1990s and early 2000s that machine learning began to receive
greater attention. Algorithms such as SVM and Random Forests are becoming popular
and used in various applications.

#### Data Mining (Data Role)
The increasing availability of data is an important factor in the development of
machine learning. Abundant data allows algorithms to learn better and produce more
accurate predictions.

#### Deep Learning is born
Deep learning began to show its potential in the early 2010s, especially with deep
learning's victory in the ImageNet competition in 2012. Since then, deep learning
has revolutionized various fields and become one of the most active areas of AI
research.

#### General AI Used
AI continues to develop rapidly. Research focuses on a variety of areas. AI
continues to develop and has a big impact on human life.

### AI and Robot

The question of the relationship between AI and robots definitely exists. AI as a
brain rather than a robot. Think of it like human implementation of technology.
Even robots without AI can do it. Robots without AI as long as control do not
cause serious problems.

## How to learn more (more)?
To find out more, you can search for AI yourself or just ask AI. In IA or Internet Archive, it can be seen on the [Official Internet Archive Site](https://archive.org).
